# Asclepius

Asclepius is an Android application developed as a final project for the **Applying Machine Learning for Android** course in the **MBKM Bangkit 2024 Batch 2** program.

This app utilizes a TensorFlow Lite model and starter project provided by Dicoding. It enables users to detect skin cancer through image classification, based on images taken from the camera or selected from the gallery.

## Features

- ✅ **Dynamic Theme Support**  
  Automatically switches between **Light** and **Dark** mode based on the user's device settings.

- ✅ **Image Selection**  
  Allows users to choose images from the **gallery** or capture a new photo using the **camera**.

- ✅ **Image Cropping**  
  Integrated with **uCrop** to crop the selected image before analysis.

- ✅ **Skin Cancer Detection**  
  Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model to classify the image as either **Cancer** or **No Cancer**.

- ✅ **Confidence Score**  
  Displays prediction confidence (dependencies score) for the detected result in the result screen.
